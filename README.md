# stm32_projects_for_memorize
 There is a lot of code created for different projects during my undergraduate time between 2016 and 2018 which is almost based on stm32 f1/f4.  They has little value for further reference, but they are testimonies of my college days.  
 There is a special project based on a MCU called Renesas RX23T, which contains of part of the code that won me the most important award during my college days.  
 Most of them are ugly.
